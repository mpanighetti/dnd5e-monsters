# Gina

**Gina** is a young reigar exploring the stars for the first time alongside the [Antipelan Society](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-mote/tree/main/organizations/antipelan-society/antipelan-society.md).

## Information

### Mental

- pronouns: she/they

### Physical

- species: reigar
- skin: iridescent

Gina's skin resembles that of a cuttlefish, with intricate colorful patterns that shift in response to changes in their emotional state and to provide subtle camouflage.

## History

Gina is on a quest to construct their first talarith. Collecting the materials necessary for this arcane construction requires going on a pilgrimage and taking prizes from enemies felled in combat. This bloodlust can come off as unsettling to some, and her cheery disposition and matter-of-factness doesn't necessarily provide any balancing comfort.

Having been raised with her people's love of violence and destruction as artistic expression, Gina has taken up painting as a hobby, but uses pigments derived from blood and other vital fluids.
