# Fellcock

Though uninterested in the typical frivolous pursuits of nobility in life, Lord Strahd. von Zarovich did indulge himself with a small population of exotic peacocks that lived in the hills around Ravenloft. After Barovia was forever corrupted by Strahd's pledge to the Dark Powers, the unattended peacocks broke out of their pens, transforming over generations into feral carnivorous terrors. These fellcock hunt in small packs, surrounding isolated prey such as injured deer to cut them off from the rest of the herd. Fellcock victims can generally be identified by their missing brains, hearts, and livers (as these are their primary diets), along with a scattering of brilliant red feathers soaked in their meal's blood, but unless collected and cleaned quickly, their bloody shed plumage dissolves into ichor by the next sunrise.
