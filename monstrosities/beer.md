# Beer

#### Description

A monstrous cross between apid and ursid, a beer combines the aggression and territoriality of a bee with the doesn't-die-when-it-hurts-you-once of a bear. Beers fill an important ecological niche, acting as pollinators of winter pansies and snow flowers in regions where normal bees are unable to survive. Their large bodies have layers of fat that protect them from the low temperatures.

Beers can live on typical bear diets, but their innate craving for honey leads them to produce their own, particularly when providing for their young. An adult beer's can easily fell large evergreens and strip their back to expose their sap, which they collect in cheek pouches and bring back to their hexagonal dens to produce honey. Beer honey is nutrient-rich and highly desirable by humanoid societies, but the inherent danger of attempting to collect it from a beer's den means such efforts are only attempted by the particularly brave or foolish.

Like their insectoid brethren, beers are highly social and supportive of other beers from the same pack. When one beer is in distress, it emits a powerful pheromone calling other beers to its aid. And like the ursine creatures they resemble, a beer will relentlessly attack anything that endangers them or their cubs. These combined traits lead most aspiring beerkeepers to think better of such endeavors.

#### Special Traits

_**Charge.**_ If the beer moves at least 10 feet in a straight line before hitting a creature with its claws, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

_**Pheremones.**_ The beer has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. Additionally, up to a range of 1 mile, the beer knows the exact location of every other beer and any creature cursed by the **Mark of the Hive** bonus action, as well as whether that creature has been damaged or is attacking another creature.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The beer makes two attacks with its claws and one with its stinger.

_**Claws.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.

_**Stinger (Recharge 5-6).**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) poison damage, and the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed. At the end of each of their turns, the creature can repeat their saving throw, ending the paralyzed condition on a successful save.

#### Bonus Actions

_**Mark of the Hive (1/Day).**_ The beer targets a creature it can see or smell within 30 feet and uses its pheromones to place a curse on the target, marking the creature as an enemy of the hive. While cursed in this manner, all beers have advantage on attacks they make against the target. This curse lasts for 24 hours or until the target dies.
