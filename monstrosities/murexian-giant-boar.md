#### Special Traits

_**Charge.**_ If the boar moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits them with a tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) Slashing damage. If the target is a creature, they must succeed on a DC 13 Strength Saving Throw or be knocked Prone.

_**Murexian Poison.**_ All murexian Poison damage and conditions dealt by the boar treat Poison immunity as Poison resistance and ignore a target's normal Poison resistance, unless the target has specific resistance or immunity to murexian Poisons. Targets with Poison immunity or murexian Poison resistance have Advantage on Saving Throws against murexian Poison, and targets with murexian Poison immunity automatically succeed on such Saving Throws.

_**Enhanced Poisonous Skin.**_ If another creature comes into direct contact with the boar's body (including as part of the boar's Tusk attack), they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution Saving Throw or become Poisoned with murex for 1 minute and Paralyzed until the end of their next turn. A Poisoned creature no longer in direct contact with the boar can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success.

_**Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).**_ If the boar takes 10 damage or less that would reduce them to 0 Hit Points, they are reduced to 1 Hit Point instead.

#### Actions

_**Tusk.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) Slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) murexian Poison damage.
