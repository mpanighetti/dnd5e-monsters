#### Special Traits

_**Charge.**_ If the boar moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

_**Murexian Poison.**_ All murexian poison damage and poisoned conditions dealt by the boar treat poison immunity as poison resistance and ignore a target's normal poison resistance, unless the target has specific resistance or immunity to murexian poisons. Targets with poison immunity or murexian poison resistance have advantage on saves against murexian poisons, and targets with murexian poison immunity automatically succeed on such saves.

_**Enhanced Poisonous Skin.**_ If another creature comes into direct contact with the boar's body (including as part of the boar's Tusk attack), it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned with murex for 1 minute and paralyzed until the end of its next turn. A poisoned creature no longer in direct contact with the boar can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

_**Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).**_ If the boar takes 10 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.

#### Actions

_**Tusk.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) murexian poison damage.
