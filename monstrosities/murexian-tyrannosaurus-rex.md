#### Special Traits

_**Murexian Poison.**_ All murexian poison damage and poisoned conditions dealt by T. rex treat poison immunity as poison resistance and ignore a target's normal poison resistance, unless the target has specific resistance or immunity to murexian poisons. Targets with poison immunity or murexian poison resistance have advantage on saves against murexian poisons, and targets with murexian poison immunity automatically succeed on such saves.

_**Venom Surge.**_ If another creature comes into direct contact with T. rex's body (including as part of T. rex's Bite or Tail attack), it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned with murex for 1 minute and paralyzed until the end of its next turn. A poisoned creature no longer in direct contact with T. rex can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Additionally, a creature that is already poisoned by murex and fails this saving throw instead suffers one level of exhaustion. A creature cannot have more than one level of exhaustion at a time caused by the Venom Surge trait from the same murexian creature.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ T. rex makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.

_**Bite.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 32 (4d12 + 6) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) murexian poison damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, and T. rex can't bite another target.

_**Tail.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) murexian poison damage.
