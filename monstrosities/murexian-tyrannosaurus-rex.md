#### Special traits

_**Murexian Poison.**_ All murexian Poison damage and conditions dealt by T. rex treat Poison immunity as Poison resistance and ignore a target's normal Poison resistance, unless the target has specific resistance or immunity to murexian Poison. Targets with Poison immunity or murexian Poison resistance have Advantage on Saving Throws against murexian Poison, and targets with murexian Poison immunity automatically succeed on such Saving Throws.

_**Venom Surge.**_ If another creature comes into direct contact with T. rex's body (including as part of T. rex's Bite or Tail attack), they must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution Saving Throw or become Poisoned with murex for 1 minute and Paralyzed until the end of their next turn. A Poisoned creature no longer in direct contact with T. rex can repeat the Saving Throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success.

Additionally, a creature that is already Poisoned by murex and fails this Saving Throw instead suffers one level of Exhaustion. A creature cannot have more than one level of Exhaustion at a time caused by the Venom Surge trait from the same murexian creature.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ T. rex makes two attacks: one with their bite and one with their tail. They can't make both attacks against the same target.

_**Bite.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 32 (4d12 + 6) Piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) murexian Poison damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, they are Grappled (escape DC 17). Until the Grapple ends, the target is Restrained, and T. rex can't bite another target.

_**Tail.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 19 (3d8 + 6) Bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) murexian Poison damage.
