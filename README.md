# dnd5e-monsters

A collection of 5e homebrew monsters and vehicles including lore, descriptions, and stat blocks.

## Resources

If a resource was written for another 5e homebrew document, it will include a link to the source at the bottom of its page.

### Monsters

Monsters are arranged by creature type and listed alphabetically, but any stat blocks that are part of a single family of creatures (e.g. void dragons) will share a single content page. Monsters with multiple creature types will be listed under whatever is considered their primary creature type.

Magic items are arranged alphabetically.

### Writing and Gameplay

## Compatibility

This content was written to be compatible with Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It makes the following modifications from the _Systems Reference Document_:

- "Species" is used in place of "race" and "ancestry" or "variant" in place of "subrace".
- This document uses new traits called **Condition Resistance** and **Condition Vulnerability**. Resistance to a condition means that a creature has Advantage on Saving Throws made to resist that condition, and vulnerability to a condition means that a creature has Disadvantage on such Saving Throws.
- Damage and condition resistance, vulnerability, and immunity are now grouped together as **Resistances**, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Immunities** respectively.
- Resistance, vulnerability, and immunity to Poison apply to both the damage type and the Poisoned condition.
