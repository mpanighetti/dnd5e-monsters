# Bathýs

If one squints, the Bathýs superficially resembles a sailing vessel one might see on the oceans of the Material Plane, but a closer examination reveals the vessel to be mechanical in design and built of a dark infernal iron. Its hull is assembled from scraps of motorized land vehicles, with large metal beams twisted into tight braids in the vague shape of a ship, but pulsing with the churning of gears and an infusion of chaotic magical energy that provides buoyancy.

The Bathýs accounts for the Stygian Sea's lack of predicable winds with an enchanted sail that allows for movement in still or opposing winds. To power this magic, a furnace in the belly of the ship fuels the mast and sails with the energy of consumed souls.

The Bathýs employs several exotic armaments, some stolen from other vessels, others repurposed from siege weaponry. The cannon on its port side provides a range and firepower not typically seen in seafaring combat, and the harpoon launcher to starboard allows for a quick method of trapping other ships for boarding and plundering.

#### Crew

The Bathýs is captained by **The Great Undying**, a sahuagin pirate in life who continued her piratical reign of terror on the hellish Stygian Sea.

Besides its captain, the ship is crewed entirely by reanimated skeletons. Magically gifted with speech and independent thought, the crew is nonetheless loyal to its captain — or too fearful of her wrath to protest.

Unlike normal skeletons, the crew of the Bathýs has had their souls, intellect, and autonomy restored, along with some of their memories from when they were living creatures. They are still obedient and faithful to The Great Undying, but this is less a compulsion of necromantic spellbinding and more out of gratitude for her taking pity on their damned souls. They can question their captain's orders but will follow them obediently unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. They can speak and read Common, Infernal, and Abyssal, allowing them to interact with the denizens of the infernal realm without difficulty.

The exception to this restoration of the soul is "Brutus", a minotaur skeleton crew member. It was animated in the more typical necromantic fashion and behaves normally (for a minotaur skeleton, anyway). Its true name is unknown as only its bones were reanimated, leaving it a mindless and obedient servant of The Great Undying and her crew.

Beyond the captain, there are no other designated officers on the ship. Instead, members of the "skeleton crew" fulfill these roles interchangeably as needed. Brutus acts as muscle to help defend the ship from hostile takeover but is otherwise kept below decks for the general safety of the crew.

#### Layout

- The Bathýs has an **infernal cannon** and 5 cannon balls on the main deck, with additional cannon balls secured in the siege weapon ammunition cabin.
- The **harpoon launcher** is on the main deck, containing one harpoon attached to the deck with a chain of infernal iron.
- The ship has one 80-foot-tall mast with a sail.
- There are no rowboats, oars, or benches.
- All wooden or iron objects and structures typical for a ship are made of infernal iron. The ship's doors and footlockers have AC 20, 18 hit points, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage.
- The hanging lanterns are under the effect of a _continual flame_ spell, with the following changes:
  - The lanterns cast dim light in a 20-foot radius.
  - The flame from these lanterns is not affected by the _darkness_ spell and ignores its effect within the light's radius.
- There is no privy.
- The medical cabin has been repurposed to hold the captain's private treasure storage, including the ship's main supply of soul coins. The door to this cabin is usually locked, the key kept by the captain.
