#### Special traits

_**Antimagic Susceptibility.**_ The corset is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by _dispel magic_, the corset must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

_**Damage Transfer.**_ While worn by a creature, the corset takes only half the damage dealt to it, and the creature wearing the corset takes the other half.

_**False Appearance.**_ While the corset remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal corset.

#### Actions

_**Cinch.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or Small creature. _Hit:_ The corset dons itself on the creature's body. While the corset is worn, the target's movement speed is halved, it is at risk of suffocating, and the corset can't cinch another target. In addition, at the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 9 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. The target can attempt to doff the corset as if escaping from a grapple (escape DC 13), or the corset can doff itself as a bonus action.
