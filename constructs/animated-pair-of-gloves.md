#### Traits

_**Antimagic Susceptibility.**_ The pair of gloves is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by _dispel magic_, the gloves must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

_**Damage Transfer.**_ While worn by a creature, the pair of gloves take only half the damage dealt to them, and the creature wearing the gloves takes the other half.

_**Matching Pair.**_ The pair of gloves fall unconscious if they are more than 40 feet apart from each other, and they remain unconscious until reunited. If they are 40 feet apart or closer and are not prevented from moving freely, as a bonus action, the gloves can reunite in any unoccupied space between their two spaces. The gloves can't take their Slip On action unless they are united in the same space.

_**False Appearance.**_ While the pair of gloves remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal pair of gloves.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The pair of gloves makes two Stop Hitting Yourself attacks against the creature wearing them.

_**Slip On.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or Small creature. _Hit:_ The pair of gloves don themselves on the creature's hands or appendages, replacing any current gloves. While the gloves are worn: any time the target attempts to make weapon attacks, interact with objects, or use somatic components for casting spells, it must first succeed on a contested Dexterity check against the gloves; and the gloves can't slip onto another creature. The target can attempt to doff the gloves as if escaping from a grapple (escape DC 14), or the gloves can doff themselves as a bonus action.

_**Stop Hitting Yourself.**_ The pair of gloves attempts to slap or punch the creature wearing them. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take bludgeoning damage equal to the creature's own unarmed strike (minimum 1).
