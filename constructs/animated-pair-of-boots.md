#### Traits

_**Antimagic Susceptibility.**_ The pair of boots is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by _dispel magic_, the boots must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

_**Damage Transfer.**_ While worn by a creature, the pair of boots take only half the damage dealt to them, and the creature wearing the boots takes the other half.

_**Matching Pair.**_ The pair of boots fall unconscious if they are more than 40 feet apart from each other, and they remain unconscious until reunited. If they are 40 feet apart or closer and are not prevented from moving freely, as a bonus action, the boots can reunite in any unoccupied space between their two spaces. The boots can't take their Lace Up action unless they are united in the same space.

_**False Appearance.**_ While the pair of boots remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal pair of boots.

#### Actions

_**Lace Up.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or Small creature. _Hit:_ The pair of boots don themselves on the creature's feet, replacing any current footwear. While the boots are worn, the creature is grappled (escape DC 14), and the boots can't lace up another creature. Until this grapple ends, the target's movement is controlled by the boots. The boots can move a grappled creature up to the boots' full movement speed. The boots can doff themselves as a bonus action.

#### Reactions

_**Trip.**_ While worn, the pair of boots can force the creature wearing them to reroll a successful attack roll, skill check, or saving throw, and the creature must take the lower result.
