# Trickered Treat

## Lore

A creation of hags tired of Feywild children demanding sweets at all hours of the night, trickered treats are animated candies designed to look as inviting and appetizing as possible, so that they might tempt would-be victims into having a taste. Such temptations are short-lived, as the candies will immediately assail anyone interacting with them, taking careful aim at the creature's mouth and pummeling their teeth until they retreat. The treats are theoretically edible, but are coated with a putrefying concoction that will cause the most steel-hearted consumer's stomach to lurch violently.

_**Constructed Nature.**_ Trickered treats do not require air, food, drink, or sleep.

_**Sugar Rush.**_ Even though trickered treats are toxic to consume, they can still confer useful benefits to anyone who can stomach them. A Small or larger creature may swallow a grappled, restrained, or incapacitated trickered treat. Doing so instantly destroys the treat, and the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 1 hour, and cannot regain hit points while poisoned in this manner. On a successful save, the creature gains the effects of the _haste_ spell for 1 minute (no concentration required).

## Special Traits

_**Antimagic Susceptibility.**_ The swarm is incapacitated while in the area of an _antimagic field_. If targeted by _dispel magic_, the swarm must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster’s spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

_**False Appearance.**_ While the swarm remains motionless and isn't flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal pile of candy.

_**Swarm.**_ The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

## Actions

_**Cavities.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. _Hit:_ 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage, or 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. If the target is a creature that has teeth and was hit by this attack, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) poison damage. The target has disadvantage on this saving throw if it has previously taken poison damage from a trickered treat in the last day.
