#### Special traits

_**Antimagic Susceptibility.**_ The esqueleto is incapacitated while in the area of an _antimagic field_. If targeted by _dispel magic_, the esqueleto must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

_**Jawbreaker.**_ If the esqueleto moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a headbutt attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 5 (2d4) damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

_**Alfeñique Nature.**_ The esqueleto doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. When the esqueleto is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses into a pile of sugar dust and is destroyed.

_**Claw.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

_**Headbutt.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
