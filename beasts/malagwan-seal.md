# Malagwan Seal

#### Lore

Selkies in their seal form bear a superficial resemblance to the seal population in the waters of Malagwa, making it easy for one to go unnoticed amongst a larger pod. Though the seals have no special connection or direct relationship to selkies, the two peacefully coexist, and selkies maintain a great respect for what they see as distant cousins.
