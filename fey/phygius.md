# Phygius


_Cervid Deity Between Worlds_

**Habitat:** Forest ([Middlestag Forest](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-mote/blob/main/mote/esterfell/lenya/middlestag-forest.md)), Planar (Feywild); **Treasure:** Relics

Legend speaks of a giant deer with three massive horns atop its head, which appears and disappears within a forest tangled in planar energies. It is from these scarce sightings in the distant past that the Middlestag Forest was given its name, but none of the local families have any more context on what the Middlestag is, where it comes from, and what it might want when it shows itself. Some have reported seeing this mighty creature appear to rapidly flicker in and out of existence, making it unclear whether what they saw was even real.

This cervid is in fact a powerful archfey named **Phygius**. It resides in the Middlestag Forest as well as its intersections with adjacent planes, seemingly jumping erratically between them. Phygius is equally within its domain whether in the forest as it manifests in [Esterfell](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-mote/blob/main/mote/esterfell/esterfell.md) or in the Feywild.

The leading theory to explain Phygius' strange interplanar nature is that it was transformed by falling [starstuff](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-mote/blob/main/artifacts/starstuff.md) millennia ago, possibly during the impact that formed Esterfell itself. Such an infusion of stellar energies could dislodge a sufficiently powerful creature from its attachment to a single plane, causing its body to physically reside in multiple adjacent planes simultaneously and periodically settle on one or another before shifting away again.

It is unclear what effect such a state of being would have on a creature's psyche, and thus far none in Esterfell have reported successfully communicating with Phygius. The courts of the Feywild respect Phygius' power and tend to leave it to its own unknowable devices.

Phygius tends to make itself visible on the Esterfell side of the forest when the barriers between planes are weakened, be it by arcanists tampering with starstuff or an impending new stellar bombardment. It is said that seeing the Middlestag on a moonlit night is a sign of strange future occurrences to come, such as the sudden appearance of frightening otherworldly creatures and the disappearance of loved ones into the Feywild.

These movements of other beings across the planes are unlikely to be Phygius' doing; rather, it seems to have the innate ability to detect openings between worlds and is drawn to them. Whether it presides over these temporary tears in reality out of approval of the blending of worlds or whether it watches over these events to try and prevent disaster is unknown, but its perceived role as a harbinger has led to fear and superstition surrounding any sightings.

Farmers and hunters in the region might revere the Stag as a minor deity, but thus far the archfey seems completely indifferent to the affairs of most mortals of Esterfell, unless they dare to tug at the edges of reality and order and move between worlds. This will draw its attention, but it is thus far unclear whether being noticed by Phygius would have a positive outcome.

#### Traits

_**Fey Resilience.**_ When Phygius drops to 0 Hit Points, it dies only if it is in the Feywild. Otherwise, Phygius drops to 1 Hit Point and teleports to a random location in the Feywild, and it can't return to the plane it left for 2d6 days. When Phygius teleports away due to this trait or dies, the area it occupied is immediately subjected to the Enrichment effect of the _Plant Growth_ spell.

_**Interplanar Nature.**_ While in the Ethereal Plane, the Feywild, or the Material Plane: Phygius can use its senses to perceive within a 30-foot Sphere of its corresponding location on each of these planes of existence; it is aware of the location and alignment of all creatures within these Spheres; and it cannot be forcibly removed from that plane of existence.

_**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).**_ If Phygius fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

_**Magic Resistance.**_ Phygius has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

_**Regeneration.**_ Phygius regains 20 Hit Points at the start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 Hit Point. If Phygius is in the Feywild at the start of its turn, it instead regains 40 Hit Points. If Phygius takes Necrotic damage, this trait doesn't function on its next turn.

#### Actions

_**Fey Step.**_ Phygius casts _Misty Step_ using the same spellcasting ability as Spellcasting.
