#### Traits

_**Aquatic Fortitude.**_ The selkie warrior is Resistant to Cold damage, and while not wearing armor, their Armor Class equals 12 + their Constitution modifier.

_**Friend of the Sea.**_ The selkie warrior can communicate simple ideas to any Beast that has a Swimming Speed using sounds and gestures, and they can understand the creature in kind.

_**Hold Breath.**_ The selkie warrior can hold their breath for 30 minutes.

_**Keen Smell.**_ The selkie warrior has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The selkie warrior makes two Trident attacks (person form) or two Bite attacks (seal form). If one of these attacks hits a creature, once on each of the selkie warrior's turns, they can create the following effect:

**Topple.** _Constitution Saving Throw:_ DC 12, a creature hit by the selkie warrior's Trident or Bite attack. _Failure:_ the creature has the Prone condition.

_**Bite (Seal Form Only).** Melee Attack Roll:_ +4, reach 5 ft. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) Piercing damage.

_**Trident (Person Form Only).** Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:_ +4, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft. _Hit:_ 4 (1d6 + 2) Piercing damage.

_**Selkie Skin.**_ The selkie warrior dons their Selkie Skin to shape-shift into their seal form, or doffs it to shape-shift into their person form. Their statistics are the same in their seal form except for where noted in this stat block, and they are considered to be in their true form in either form. Any equipment they are wearing or carrying in their person form merges into their seal form.

While the selkie warrior's skin is not merged into their form, it is a wondrous magic item with AC 11 and 3 Hit Points. The skin is destroyed if on a separate plane of existence from the selkie warrior. While another creature possesses the selkie warrior's skin, the warrior is Charmed by that creature until they no longer possess the skin, and no spell or other effect can remove this charm. If the Selkie Skin is destroyed, the selkie warrior grows a replacement skin after they complete a Long Rest.
