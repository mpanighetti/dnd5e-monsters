_**Friend of the Sea.**_ The selkie warrior can communicate simple ideas to any Beast that has a Swimming Speed using sounds and gestures, and they can understand the creature in kind.

_**Hold Breath.**_ The selkie warrior can hold their breath for 30 minutes.

_**Keen Smell.**_ The selkie warrior has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

_**Club (Person Form Only).**_ _Melee Attack Roll:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4 + 2) Bludgeoning damage.

_**Selkie Skin.**_ The selkie warrior dons their [selkie skin](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/wondrous-items/selkie-skin.md) to shape-shift into their seal form, or doffs it to shape-shift into their person form. Their statistics are the same in their seal form except for where noted in this stat block, and they are considered to be in their true form in either form. Any equipment they are wearing or carrying in their person form merges into their seal form.

While the selkie warrior's skin is not merged into their form, it is a wondrous magic item with AC 11 and 3 Hit Points. The skin is destroyed if on a separate plane of existence from the selkie warrior. If another creature Attunes to the selkie warrior's skin, the warrior is Charmed by that creature until the Attunement ends, and no spell or other effect can remove this charm. If the selkie warrior's skin is destroyed, they grow a replacement skin after they complete a Long Rest.
