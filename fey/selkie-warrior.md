#### Special Traits

_**Aquatic Fortitude.**_ The selkie warrior ignores any of the drawbacks caused by a deep, underwater environment. Additionally, while not wearing armor, the selkie's Armor Class equals 12 + its Constitution modifier (included in the stat block).

_**Friend of the Sea.**_ The selkie warrior can communicate with beasts that have a swimming speed using sounds and gestures, and can understand them in kind.

_**Hold Breath.**_ The selkie warrior can hold its breath for 30 minutes.

_**Keen Smell.**_ The selkie warrior has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The selkie warrior makes two melee attacks.

_**Bite (Seal Form Only).**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

_**Club (Person Form Only).**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

_**Selkie Skin.**_ The selkie warrior dons their [selkie skin](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/wondrous-items/selkie-skin.md) to polymorph into their seal form, or doffs it to polymorph into their person form. Their statistics are the same in their seal form form, except where differentiated in this stat block, and they are considered to be in their true form in either form. Any equipment they are wearing or carrying in their person form merges into their seal form.

While the selkie warrior's skin is not merged into their form, it is a wondrous magic item with AC 11 and 3 hit points. The skin is destroyed if on a separate plane of existence from the selkie. If another creature attunes to the selkie's skin, the selkie is charmed by that creature until the attunement ends, and no spell or other effect can remove this charm. If the skin is destroyed, the selkie grows a replacement after they complete a long rest.
