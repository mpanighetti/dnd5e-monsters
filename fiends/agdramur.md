# Ag'dramur

Just as an injured animal can still be a threat, so too is a marilith with fewer arms no less of a concern to mortals and fiends alike. Ag'dramur continues to wield her four cutlasses with a ferocity, laying waste to her enemies before they have a chance to count her limbs.

#### Background

The great flood threw normal power balances into disarray. As the landscape gradually became a seascape, the warlords who were able to adjust to newly-required skills and tactics could quickly find themselves in positions of authority and territory ownership. Ag'dramur fared better than most demons in this regard, and used her authority and strength to gather whatever supporters she could to gain headway on the new battleground.

These early successes painted a target on her back, and other demons rallied to try and take her off of the board before she could become a bigger threat. A skirmish ensued, resulting in Ag'dramur losing most of her navy. A magically aided ballista bolt took two of her arms clean off, and she barely escaped with her life.

This setback has left her at a reduced strength, but had no impact on her drive for power and conquest. Her first goal was to sneak aboard the ship that took her arms and murder its captain and crew. Their bones now line the ship's railing, and she has freshly restarted her efforts to build her military might.

#### Infernal Ship

The fiend captains an infernal ship crewed by enslaved fishfolk who came to the infernal realm accidentally through an interplanar whirlpool. The creatures aren't the powerful warriors she'd prefer to lead into battle, but their amphibious nature makes them well-suited to sail the infernal seas, and their propensity to revere whoever leads them as a demigod ensures their loyalty. All this combined with a loose grip on reality and desire for protection made their souls easily corruptible.
