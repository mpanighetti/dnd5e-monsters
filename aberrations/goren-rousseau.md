# Goren Rousseau

#### Description

The youngest of the Rousseau children, **Goren Rousseau** was corrupted by an entity from the Far Realm. This mutation cursed him with an insatiable desire to consume the life force of other creatures, including his own siblings. He now roams the house, ashamed of his terrible actions but forever compelled to feed again.

Goren's transformation does not have a prescribed fix, as even the great Lynistad Rousseau could not find a solution as she scours the planes cannot be undone by the party. Only death can grant him a release.

#### Movement

At the start of the adventure, Goren is in the ballroom of Chateau Rousseau. If Goren is unaware of the party, he mostly wanders the first floor, moving between different rooms and the hallway. Once he becomes aware that living creatures are in the House, he actively pursues them.

#### Senses

Unless the party is making successful Stealth checks against Goren's passive or active Perception (depending on whether he's tracking them), Goren will hear the group if he's up to one floor away from them, and will know what room they're in if he's on the same floor as them. Any particularly loud noises, including engaging in combat, can be easily heard by Goren up to one floor away.

The shame of his transformation has caused Goren to hate his own appearance. To that end, he has carefully covered all the mirrors in the house with blankets. If a mirror is uncovered, he averts his eyes from his reflection (see the **Negative Self-Image** trait on Goren's stat block).

Goren is unable to perceive ghosts by sight or sound. He is not aware that his siblings continue to haunt the house.

#### Traits

_**Negative Self-Image.**_ When Goren can see his own reflection, he shields his eyes, causing him to be blinded. He then spends all his actions either trying to flee or trying to cover or destroy the reflection.

_**Spider Climb.**_ Goren can climb difficult surfaces, including upside-down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

#### Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ Goren makes up to three attacks: one with his bite, and two with his claws.

_**Bite.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's Hit Point Maximum is reduced by the amount of damage taken from Goren's bite, Goren regains that number of Hit Points, and the creature is frightened of Goren for 1 minute. The frightened creature can make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The creature's Hit Point Maximum is restored to normal after a long rest.

_**Claws.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

_**Gravity Well (3/Day).**_ Goren redirects gravity in a line in front of him 60 feet long and 10 feet wide. Any creature or object in this space must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target is knocked prone and is pulled up to 20 feet toward Goren. If this movement brings a creature within Goren's reach, he can attack the creature with his claws. On a successful save, a creature lands prone as it drops down and grabs the ground to hold its position.
