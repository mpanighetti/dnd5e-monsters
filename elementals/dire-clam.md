_**Water Breathing.**_ The clam can breathe only underwater.

#### Actions

_**Crush.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) Bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature size Large or smaller, they are also Grappled (escape DC 14) as the clam closes their shell around the target. Until this Grapple ends, the target is restrained and trapped within the clam's dark interior.

The clam can Grapple one creature at a time. At the start of each of the clam's turns, a creature Grappled by the clam takes 13 (2d8 + 4) Bludgeoning damage. While Grappling a creature, the clam can't use their Crush action without opening their shell and releasing the creature from their Grapple. A creature within 5 feet of the clam can take an action to attempt to pry the clam's shell open by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check.
