# The Great Undying

Amidst the chaos of the changing seascape, an opportunistic pirate, tired of wandering the lands and protecting what remained of her tattered soul from hellish fiends, commandeered a vehile and converted it into a mighty sailing vessel. She christened her new ship the Bathýs and began patrolling the new Stygian Sea, taking up a career of piracy as she did in life. Now in her element once again, she has turned the tide against her oppressors and lives freely in the infernal realm, plundering what she can to survive and thrive as she tries to build an armada and wrest more power from the cadre of devilish rulers as they struggle to hold their positions.

#### Background

Few details are known of The Great Undying's life (or death) before the realm was flooded. What little she has revealed to her crew suggests that she was a cruel taskmaster of a pirate captain in life, and whatever horrific deeds she had done seemed to make her time in this realm a deserved punishment. But her actions after taking to the Stygian Seas indicate a deep trauma from the torture she endured as a dead soul, which in turn has given her motivation to fight back against the devils of this plane in retribution for their own misdeeds.

Seemingly with sheer determination, The Great Undying took back not only her autonomy but also her life vitality, no longer wandering as an undead soul and instead possessing her original mortal sahuagin form. It is unknown how she came upon this rare gift, as she seems to possess no magical abilities of her own, but it can be assumed that an infernal contract with a powerful fiend made this possible.

This same boon seems to have allowed her to staff the Bathýs with a literal skeleton crew possessing their souls and fractured memories. The crew is broken by their own travails, but grateful to their captain for her gift to them, which allows them the chance to fight for their own freedom alongside her.

#### Appearance

The Great Undying is a sahuagin, but for the most part has the appearance of a human with pale blue skin. Her true inhuman nature is quickly discerned, however, when she smiles, revealing rows of pointed, serrated, shark-like teeth.
