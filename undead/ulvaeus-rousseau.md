# Ulvaeus Rousseau

Ulvaeus is second-born of the Rousseau family and comes off as a competitive jock.

#### Behavior

This Rousseau child has a competitive streak, and is always looking for new challengers. They can be found in the game room of Chateau Rousseau playing billiards.

If the party asks them for help, they offer a valuable magic item, the [Mariner's Bow](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/weapons/mariners-bow.md), which will allow the party to navigate the house without succumbing to its door randomization. In exchange, one person must defeat Ulvaeus in a game of billiards, and agree to sacrifice some of their life force if they lose; this sacrifice subjects the individual to a minor curse which reduces their Hit Point Maximum by 1d4 Hit Points. This reduction remains until the curse is removed.

The billiards game is accomplished by a simple series of contested Dexterity or Intelligence checks. The player chooses which ability score is used by both contestants, and can change this choice each time. The first challenger to win five contests is the winner of the game. Players can also come up with alternative methods, such as attempting to cheat with Sleight of Hand (Dexterity) checks (Ulvaeus will never cheat), or their friends can assist with magic.

If the characters decline the game challenge, Ulvaeus says they'll be happy to engage in combat with the party, and will leave the bow behind as a prize if defeated.

Ulvaeus spends all their time in the game room, though they will temporarily become invisible if Goren enters the room.

_**Telekinetic Thrust.**_ Ulvaeus targets a creature or unattended object within 30 feet of them. A creature must be Medium or smaller to be affected by this magic, and an object can weigh up to 150 pounds.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw, or it is hurled up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward. If the hurled creature then comes into contact with a hard surface or heavy object, the target takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet moved.

If the target is an object that isn't being worn or carried, Ulvaeus hurls it up to 30 feet in any direction. Ulvaeus can use the object as a ranged weapon, attacking one creature along the object's path (+5 to hit) and dealing 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage on a hit.
