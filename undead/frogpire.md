#### Special Traits

_**Regeneration.**_ The frogpire regains 1d4 Hit Points at the start of their turn. If the frogpire takes Radiant damage or is in sunlight, this trait doesn't function at the start of the frogpire's next turn. If the frogpire starts their turn with 0 Hit Points and doesn't regenerate, they are destroyed.

_**Spider Climb.**_ The frogpire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

_**Standing Leap.**_ The frogpire's long jump is up to 10 feet and their high jump is up to 5 feet, with or without a running start.

_**Vampiric Weaknesses.**_ The frogpire has the following flaws:

_Forbiddance._ The frogpire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

_Stake to the Heart._ If a Piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the frogpire's heart while the frogpire is incapacitated in their swamp, the frogpire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

#### Actions

_**Tongue (Frogpire Form Only).**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ the target is Grappled (escape DC 13). While a creature is Grappled in this manner, the frogpire cannot attack any other creatures.

_**Bite. (Frogpire Form Only).**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is Grappled by the frogpire, incapacitated, or restrained. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) Piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. The target's Hit Point Maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the frogpire's Hit Points and Hit Point Maximum increase by the same amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a Long Rest. The target dies if this effect reduces their Hit Point Maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then submerged in swamp water rises the following night as 2d6 frogpire spawn under the frogpire's control.

_**Charm.**_ The frogpire targets one humanoid they can see within 30 feet of them. If the target can see or hear the frogpire, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom Saving Throw against this magic or be Charmed by the frogpire. The Charmed target regards the frogpire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the frogpire's control, they take the frogpire's actions in the most favorable way they can, they attempt to anticipate the frogpire's desires, and they are a willing target for the frogpire's bite attack.

Each time the frogpire or the frogpire's companions do anything harmful to the target, they can repeat the Saving Throw, ending the effect on themself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 1 hour or until the frogpire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a Bonus Action to end the effect.

_**Shapechange.**_ If the frogpire isn't in sunlight, they polymorph into a Tiny cloud of flies, or back into their true form.

While in cloud of flies form, the frogpire can't take any actions or manipulate objects. They are weightless, they have a Flying Speed of 20 feet, they can hover, and they can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the cloud of flies can do so without squeezing. They have Advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution Saving Throws, and they are immune to all nonmagical damage.
