# Neta Rousseau

Neta is the second-youngest Rousseau. She enjoys reading and is always looking for new books, but at this point she's gone through everything in the House that she can find.

#### Behavior

Neta used to wander the halls of the House but hasn't left the Chateau Rousseau library in a very long time. If Goren enters the room, she will become invisible until he leaves.

If the party asks her for help, she will offer useful information. She learned how to leave the House after she died, and will explain how to use the signet rings and where to find two of them; she never found the _Ruby Signet_ but assumes it's in the one room she can't visit, that of her mother Lynistad. She also can tell them another route into Lynistad's room since the front door is impenetrable: the dumbwaiter in the house's kitchen connects to it directly. Before providing any of these helpful clues, she asks the party for a new book that she's never read before. This challenge is open-ended; characters can give her a journal, spell book, or any other reading material from their starting equipment, and it will generally satisfy her request.

If the party has no books to offer, she will gladly take some life force from one volunteer in exchange. This sacrifice subjects the individual to a minor curse which reduces their Hit Point Maximum by 1d4 Hit Points. This reduction remains until the curse is removed.

Like Ulvaeus, Neta also is happy to challenge the party to friendly combat for the information. If the party agrees, or if they attempt to attack Neta, a **swarm of animated books** begins to magically swirl about, and a **magma mephit** leaps out of the fireplace. Neta will let her creations fight for her but will defend herself if attacked.
